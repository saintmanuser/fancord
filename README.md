Fancord is a fork of [Equicord](https://github.com/Equicord/Equicord), which itself builds on top of [Vencord](https://github.com/Vendicated/Vencord). We stripped out the obfuscation, cleaned things up, added our own stuff, and kept what works. No bloat, no nonsense.

---

## What's in it

- **Faster startup** — no obfuscation means the client loads noticeably quicker and sits lighter on your CPU and RAM.
- **Auto-updates** — checks for updates in the background on launch and applies them silently. You don't have to think about it.
- **Plugin support** — compatible with the existing plugin ecosystem. Install community plugins straight from Git links.
- **Better audio** — hardware-optimized voice modules for cleaner, louder audio out of the box.
- **Custom styling** — our own visual tweaks on top of the base: smoother UI, custom icons, a few quality-of-life details here and there.

## Installation (Windows)

1. Download [**`fancord-install.ps1`**](./fancord-install.ps1)
2. Right-click → **Run with PowerShell**
3. Follow the steps, restart Discord, done.

---

## Building from source

If you want to dig into the code or build it yourself:

**You'll need:**
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/download)
- [Node.js (LTS)](https://nodejs.dev/en/)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation) — `npm install -g pnpm`

```bash
git clone https://github.com/fancordoff/fancordclient.git
cd fancordclient
pnpm install
pnpm build
```

Then inject into Discord:

```bash
pnpm inject
```

To go back to stock Discord:

```bash
pnpm uninject
```

## Credits

Fancord wouldn't exist without [Equicord](https://github.com/Equicord/Equicord) and [Vencord](https://github.com/Vendicated/Vencord). A huge chunk of what makes this work comes directly from their projects. We're fully aware of that and genuinely appreciate everything they've built — we're just taking it in a different direction. Big thanks to everyone who's contributed to both.
